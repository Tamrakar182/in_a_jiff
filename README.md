## In a Jiff
A simple gif search engine that I made by using Flask and utilizing the Tenor V2 API. This was my first project using Flask and I learnt a lot. Below are the steps required to get this working:

# Create Virtual Environment
```python -m venv .\venv```

# Activate Virtual Environment
```venv\Scripts\activate.bat```

# Install all the Dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Run it in local host
```flask run```
